<div class="entry-text"><p>I used mako for <a href="http://github.com/teepark/teepark.github.com/tree/master/templates/">this blog's templates</a> primarily because I hadn't ever used mako for anything and I was curious. I have used cheetah and django templates pretty extensively, and so after rolling jinja in with django and discarding anything XML-based, mako is pretty much the only major python-based templating system I don't yet know.</p>
<p>In my experience templating engines pretty well fall into two philosophical camps - those that want to expose a full-featured language, and those that intentionally restrict the power of the template code to enforce separation of concerns. When it comes to web frameworks I definitely throw my hat in with the latter crowd, having seen too many cases of a powerful templating language being used for model, controller and view code all in one. I think that django strikes the right mix of a templating language which is limited to display logic out-of-the-box, but which is also extensible and exposes lower-level machinery so you can break that paradigm if you want, but you have to <em>really</em> want to.</p>
<p>For this project which only uses the server to serve <a href="/entries/the-blogging-unengine.html">static content</a>, I wanted the template to be essentially the lowest level in the stack (there is only a <a href="http://github.com/teepark/teepark.github.com/blob/master/generate.py">very thin</a> controller layer), and therefore wanted powerful templates. The thing I dislike about cheetah the most is that if that power is going to be exposed, I shouldn't have to prefix every code statement with a special character (#), or use extra keywords for things like assigning to variables (set). As the <a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/">mako homepage</a> says, "Python is a great scripting language. Don't reinvent the wheel...your templates can handle it!"</p>
<p>Unfortunately, mako seems to have some serious problems of its own. One is syntax overload. You have simple expression escaping with the familiar ${...} notation, python blocks with &lt;% ... %&gt;, module-level python blocks with &lt;%! ... %&gt;, a myriad of xml-ish tags like &lt;%include&gt;...</%include> (srsly?), and finally cheetah-style inline statements, prefixed with "%". What is the deal? Django has 2 pieces of syntax: {% tag %}...{% endtag %} and {{ variable }}. Cheetah also has two: ${...} (with curly-braces optional) and line-leading "#" for statements. This is a big problem.</p>
<p>Another issue issue I have had seems to have significant overlap with a pattern that I would imagine to be a major use-case. It is that there is no way to store a variable in a global namespace from a parent template and have it visible in the child (I am ready to be corrected on this point, I just couldn't find one). My problem is that I have an embed from twitter for which I need to place a <div> in the right place in the markup, and a <script> at the end of the body. What I'd like to do is expose a function from the base template that embeds the <div> and sets a global variable, so that in the parent's body it can know that the <div> is there and include the <script>. Instead I'm having to expose two functions, twitter_embed() and twitter_js(), and call them both in the right places in the child. Adam Gomaa explains the issues here <a href="http://adam.gomaa.us/blog/2007/aug/13/mako-problems/#namespace">pretty well</a>. In contrast, cheetah's inheritance simply maps straight onto python class inheritance. Django doesn't allow setting variables from within templates by default, but the way you would do it with a custom tag would be to apply it to the context, which is render-wide, so would make it up to parents and down to children.</p></div>
